# Welcome to blogApp

Here is Davoud's submission.

The project is complete except the front-end testing which as mentioned I am not familiar with  Although if I had a few more days I could manage to learn and implement it  

## How to start

1. From server and client folder, install dependencies.
2. If you have nodmon installed globally then you can run each witht he following command:

```terminal
npm start
```

3. if you don't have nodemon installed **server** can be started from its folder with this command: (for client previoues command would work)

```terminal
nodemon ./index.js
```

4. to run the tests for server, from server folder run:

```terminal
npm run test
```


## Status Features to implement

- [x] sub comments can not be edited or deleted.

- [ ] Front-end testing is *not* implemented.

- [x] Back-end must delete any sub comments when a parent comment is deleted!


## Things I can do to improve it

- [x] Refactor the front-end
- [ ] Add more edge cases for back-end test
- [x] Fix a front-end bug: when new comment added it won't correctly show it.
