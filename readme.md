# Welcome to blogApp

Here is Davoud's submission.

Did not have enough time. Although implemented almost the entire project.

## Missing Features

- [ ] sub comments can not be edited or deleted.

- [ ] Front-end testing is not implemented. Despite not being familiar with front-end testing I could manage to do it if I was given a few more hours.

- [ ] Back-end must delete any sub comments when a parent comment is deletedl


## Things I can do to improve it

- [ ] Refactor the front-end
- [ ] Add more edge cases for back-end test
- [ ] Fix a front-end bug: when new comment added it won't correctly show it.
